# Project Skeleton Development Script



The script below helps in creating a basic template for a data analysis project. It generates the folders and files 

## Project Overview



 A good workflow for a particular team depends on the tasks, goals,
and values of that team, whether they want to make their work
faster, more efficient, correct, compliant, agile, transparent, or
reproducible

### Data and Code Organization

The [`Cookie-Cutter`](cookie_cutter.sh) shell script creates a basic directory structure that might be useful for set-up a Data Science project

 
 
* The directories created using the shell script under are :
  1. `CITATION` : For including any References or Citation docs for this project
  2. `src` : source code files. 
  3. `data` : where all the data files may be stored
  4. `doc`: For storing import docs, discussions or scripts for this project
  5. `bin` : Model outputs and iterations
  6. `results` : for storing the results of analysis or sample results from toolkit.
  7. The License File for this project is included can be generated out of the 4 options: MIT, GNU, BSD - 3 Clause, Apache. A menu option lets you choose the License you want to include in the folder.
  8. `requirements.txt`: To store information about all the requirements that might be re-create the analysis or to run a toolkit.
